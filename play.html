        <p>SCENE II.--HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES</p>
        <h6>JAC.</h6>  <p>(_at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he
        came in_).</p> <p> I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
        feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.  </p>

        <h6> HAR.</h6> <p>What! Him who has robbed me?  </p>

            <h6> JAC.</h6><p>I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
        me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.  </p>

        <h6>HAR.</h6> <p>This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of
        something else to this gentleman.  </p>

        <h6>OFF.</h6><p> (_to_ JACQUES).</p><p> Don't get frightened. I am not a man to cause any
        scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means.  </p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6><p> (_to_ HARPAGON).</p> <p>Is this gentleman coming to supper with you?  </p>

        <h6>OFF.</h6> <p>You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your
        master.  </p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6><p> Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in
        the best manner I possibly can.  </p>

        <h6>OFF.</h6><p> That's not the question.  </p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6><p> If I do not give as good fare as I should like, it is the fault
        of your steward, who has clipped my wings with the scissors of his
        economy.  </p>

        <h6>HAR.</h6><p> Rascal! We have other matters to talk about than your supper; and
        I want you to tell me what has become of the money which has been
        stolen from me.  </p>

        <h6>JAC.</h6><p> Some money has been stolen from you?  </p>

        <h6>HAR.</h6><p> Yes, you rascal! And I'll have you hanged if you don't give it me
       back again.  </p>

       <h6>OFF.</h6> <p> (_to_ HARPAGON).</p> <p> Pray, don't be hard upon him. I see by his looks
       that he is an honest fellow, and that he will tell you all you want to
       know without going to prison. Yes, my friend, if you confess, no harm
       shall come to you, and you shall be well rewarded by your master. Some
       money has been stolen from him, and it is not possible that you know
       nothing about it.  </p>

       <h6>JAC.</h6> <p> (_aside_).</p><p> The very thing I wanted in order to be revenged of our
      steward. Ever since he came here, he has been the favourite, and his
      advice is the only one listened to. Moreover, I have forgotten neither
      the cudgelling of to-day nor ...  </p>
